WelcomeMessage is a simple addon for all versions of World of Warcraft which displays a randomly selected motivational message into the chat box upon logging in. 

You can install the addon by downloading the file from here or on CurseForge, and add the "WelcomeMessage" folder to the "Addons" folder of your game install directory. 

E.g. C:\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\WelcomeMessage
